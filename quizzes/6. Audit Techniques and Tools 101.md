___
#### Q3 These audit techniques are especially well-suited for smart contracts (compared to Web2 programs)
- [ ] A) Formal verification because contracts are relatively smaller with specific properties
- [ ] B) Fuzzing because anyone can send random inputs to contracts on blockchain
- [ ] C) Static source-code analysis because contracts are expected to be open-source
- [ ] D) High-coverage testing because contract states and transitions are relatively fewer
