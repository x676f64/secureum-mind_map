Note: All 8 questions in this quiz are based on the InSecureumToken contract shown below. This is the same contract you see for all the 8 questions in this quiz. The InSecureumToken contract implements a token contract which allows users to buy tokens by depositing Ether (at a certain conversion ratio), and transfer tokens.

```
pragma solidity 0.7.0;

contract InSecureumToken {

mapping(address => uint) private balances;

uint public decimals = 10**18; // decimals of the token
uint public totalSupply; // total supply
uint MAX_SUPPLY = 100 ether; // Maximum total supply

event Mint(address indexed destination, uint amount);

function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
   // save the balance in local variables
   // so that we can re-use them multiple times
   // without paying for SLOAD on every access
   uint balance_from = balances[msg.sender];
   uint balance_to = balances[to];
   require(balance_from >= amount);
   balances[msg.sender] = balance_from - amount;
   balances[to] = safeAdd(balance_to, amount);
}


/// @notice Allow users to buy token. 1 ether = 10 tokens
/// @dev Users can send more ether than token to be bought, to donate a fee to the protocol team.
function buy(uint desired_tokens) public payable {
   // Check if enough ether has been sent
   uint required_wei_sent = (desired_tokens / 10) * decimals;
   require(msg.value >= required_wei_sent);

   // Mint the tokens
   totalSupply = safeAdd(totalSupply, desired_tokens);
   balances[msg.sender] = safeAdd(balances[msg.sender], desired_tokens);
   emit Mint(msg.sender, desired_tokens);
}


/// @notice Add two values. Revert if overflow
function safeAdd(uint a, uint b) pure internal returns(uint) {
   if (a + b < a) {
      revert();
   }
   return a + b;
}
}
```
