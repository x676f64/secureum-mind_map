# 50 - [Consensus](Consensus.md)

Decentralized consensus in the context of Ethereum refers to the process of determining which miner’s block should be appended next to the blockchain. 

This involves two key components of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and the Longest-chain Rule. Miners apply these rules to build on the canonical blockchain. 

This is referred to as "Nakamoto Consensus” and is adapted from Bitcoin.
